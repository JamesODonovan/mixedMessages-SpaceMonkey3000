## Space Monkey 3000 - An Introduction

When i was in middle school, one of the older students showed me a game where one person would tell a story involving a character from space. At the time i was not aware of roleplaying games, but this was definitely my first introduction. I would often play my version, Space Monkey 3000, in class with my neighbor when we were supposed to be paying attention. I would set up a scenario for my friend, and then I have them play it out whilst I played Game Master.

## Message Generator

This message generator sets up an intital scenario for the Space Monkey 3000 game. With randomized _Locations_, _Scenarios_, and items.

_Location_ & _Scenario_ are randomnly selected with an equal chance.

_Items_ have their own rarity value, which are added to the players items with a randomn roll on each item in the list; players could have all items, or end up with nothing.

Along with the randomized locations, scenarios, and items, there is one scenario (the 'poker' scenario) where the players cards are randomized and included in the scenario.

## Running the program
